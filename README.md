# Modernize WP Caption ShortCode
Customizes the output of the WP caption shortcode with `<picture>` element for different formats.

## Usage
- create a folder `mu-plugins` inside your WordPress `wp-content` folder (unless it exists already)
- place the file `modernize-wp-caption-shortcode.php` inside the folder
- ensure you have some logic implemented to generate WebP (or any other format you add to the code) separately
